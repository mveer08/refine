## What is refine?

<!-- **refine** is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based framework for building internal tools, rapidly. :sparkles: Works with any UI framework

Refine offers lots of out-of-the box functionality for rapid development, without compromising extreme customizability. Use-cases include, but are not limited to _admin panels_, _B2B applications_ and _dashboards_. -->

refine is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based framework for rapid building of internal tools. It's is a a collection of helper hooks, components and providers. They are all decoupled from your UI components and business logic, so they never keep you from customizing your UI or coding your own flow.

Refine offers lots of out-of-the box functionality for rapid development, without compromising extreme customizability. Use-cases include, but are not limited to admin panels, B2B applications and dashboards.

<!-- ## What is a "headless" Framework?
**refine** is a **headless** React framework, which means all out-of-the-box features(**Routing**, **Networking**, **Authentication**, **Authorization**, **State Management**, **Realtime**, **i18n**, etc.), it can be used without being tied to any UI elements or framework. Also, Ant Design as out-of-the-box is supported.

- Customization & Extensibility -  UI is a completely customizable area and each developer uses different solutions. **refine** features does not restrict or interfere with your UI structure. **refine** allows the you to design and customizable the UI based on their unique use case.

- Separation of Concerns - **refine** as a framework, is not responsible for your UI and is independent.

- Maintenance - By removing the API surface to support every UI use case, **refine** easy to use and update/maintain is simple.

## Key features

🔥 **Headless** : Works with any UI framework

⚙️ **Zero-configuration** : One-line setup with [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate). It takes less than a minute to start a project.

📦 **Out-of-the-box** : Routing, networking, authentication, state management, i18n and UI.

🔌 **Backend Agnostic** : Connects to any custom backend. Built-in support for [REST API](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/simple-rest), [GraphQL](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/graphql), [NestJs CRUD](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/nestjsx-crud), [Airtable](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/airtable), [Strapi](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/strapi), [Strapi v4](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/strapi-v4), [Strapi GraphQL](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/strapi-graphql), [Supabase](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/supabase), [Hasura](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/hasura), [Nhost](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/nhost), [Appwrite](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/appwrite), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Directus](https://directus.io/) and [Altogic](https://github.com/pankod/refine/tree/master/packages/altogic).

📝 **Native Typescript Core** : You can always opt out for plain JavaScript.

🐜 **Enterprise UI** : Works seamlessly with Ant Design System, and Material UI. (Support for other UI frameworks is on the Roadmap)

📝 **Boilerplate-free Code** : Keeps your codebase clean and readable.

### Motivation

Higher-level frontend frameworks can save you a lot time, but they typically offer you a trade-off between speed and flexibility.

After many years of experience in developing B2B frontend applications and working with popular frameworks, we came up with a new approach to tackle this dilemma. This is how **refine** is born.

As **refine** is totally _unopinionated_ about UI and logic, it's strongly _opinionated_ about three parts of your application:

1. **API Networking**
2. **State Management**
3. **Authentication & Authorization**

We believe, these are the most important components of a data-intensive frontend application and should be handled in a robust way by leveraging industry best practices.

**refine** guarantees you a perfect implementation of these building blocks in your project, so you can focus on your development.

### Architecture

**refine** makes extensive use of [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper) as a default way for interacting with your components.
Under the hood, **refine** relies heavily to [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for data handling, caching and state management.
Access to external sources and API's happen via providers which are basically plug-in type components for extendibility.

### Benchmark

After releasing the first internal versions, we had the chance to migrate some of our _React_ projects to **refine**.
In addition to **shorter development** times and **overall performance gains**, we've measured significant reduction in project size.

**refine** makes your codebase significantly smaller, by eliminating redundant code such as _reducers_, _actions_ and _unit tests_. Below is a size comparison for an example project:

### Quick Start

Run the **superplate** tool with the following command:

```
npx superplate-cli -p refine-react tutorial
```

Follow the _CLI wizard_ to select options and start creating your project.

After setup is complete, navigate to the project folder and start your project with:

```
npm run dev
```

Your **refine** application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Replace the contents of `App.tsx` with the following code:

```tsx title="App.tsx"

const App: React.FC = () => {

            resources={[{ name: "posts", list: PostList }]}
        />
    );
};

export const PostList: React.FC = () => {
    const { tableProps } = useTable<IPost>();

    const categoryIds =
        tableProps?.dataSource?.map((item) => item.category.id) ?? [];

    const { data, isLoading } = useMany<ICategory>({
        resource: "categories",
        ids: categoryIds,
        queryOptions: {
            enabled: categoryIds.length > 0,
        },
    });

    return (
        <List>
            <Table<IPost> {...tableProps} rowKey="id">
                <Table.Column dataIndex="title" title="title" />
                <Table.Column

                    title="category"
                    render={(value: number) => {
                        if (isLoading) {
                            return "loading...";
                        }

                        return data?.data.find(
                            (item: ICategory) => item.id === value,
                        )?.title;
                    }}
                />
                <Table.Column
                    dataIndex="createdAt"
                    title="createdAt"
                    render={(value: string) => (
                        <DateField format="LLL" value={value} />
                    )}
                />
            </Table>
        </List>
    );
};

export default App;
```

```tsx title="interfaces.d.ts"
interface IPost {
    title: string;
    createdAt: string;
    category: { id: number };
}

interface ICategory {
